          A better approach is to make a few small changes at a time. Keeping
          your goals modest can help you achieve more in the long term without
          feeling deprived or overwhelmed by a major diet overhaul.

          <h3>Buttermilk Mashed Potatoes</h3>
          <p>
            My sister-in-law, who is a dietitian, shared these buttermilk
            crushed potatoes with me. The garlic and buttermilk in these smooth
            crushed potatoes that are preferable for you over run of the mill
            forms that incorporate bunches of spread. â€” Stephanie Bremson of
            Kansas City, Missouri

          <h3>Frosted Pumpkin Cranberry Bars</h3>
          <p>
            With tangy dried cranberries tucked inside and a creamy brown butter
            frosting, these mildly spiced pumpkin bars are doubly delightful.
            It's a good thing the recipe makes lots, because once you taste one,
            you won't be able to resist going back for more!

          <h3>Cinnamon Apple Cheesecake</h3>
          <p>
            Who hasn't fallen enthralled of dulce de leche or, as it's brought
            in Chile, manjar? In this tempting cheesecake, gourmet expert Pilar
            Rodriguez, from Santa Cruz in the Colchagua wine area, prepares the
            rich filling in a cereal outside and tops each cut with
            cinnamon-scented, sauteed apple cuts.
